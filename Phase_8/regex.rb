# if "Data Abstraction in modules: In Ruby, Modules are defined as a set of methods, classes, and constants together.For example, consider the sqrt() method present in Math module. Whenever we need to calculate the square root of a non negative number, We simply call the sqrt() method present in the Math module and send the number as a parameter without understanding the actual algorithm that actually calculates the square root of the numbers.".match(/Encap/)
